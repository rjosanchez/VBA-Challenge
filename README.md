# VBA-Challenge

I broke up this code into two parts...

Part 1 created a summary table using the original data in the file
    References: Class activity solved version of credit_card_solution was copied and edited as needed; for highlighting code I referenced youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P38c_Wp9CgU

Part 2 created a table using the summary table from part 1
    References: code for calculating values referenced youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2gHMOTNyB4; code for changing the number format to percent referenced https://www.educba.com/vba-number-format/

To make it run on the other worksheets I referenced youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRDlH8phxEY
